			<h2>Web Technologies Story</h2>
			<p>Once upon a time, there was an ITD 110 student who loved video games. One day, they decided to create their own game.
                Of course, they need a website to showcase the awesome game. They spent "countless" hours learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and 
                launched their game wesbite. Due to the features and responsiveness across all platforms and devices, the website was more popular
                than the game itself.  The ITD student saw this as an opportunity to create a web development company, and Web Technologies LLC was born.
