	<tr>
		<td>TERM</td>
		<td>DEFINITION</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Machine Language</td>
		<td>Programs for modern computers consist of sequences of instructions that are encoded as numeric digits.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Debugging</td>
		<td>Locating errors in code that must be corrected.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Assembler</td>
		<td>Convert mnemonic expressions into machine language instructions.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Assembly Language</td>
		<td>Mnemonic system for representing programs.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Translator</td>
		<td>Translates programs expressed in these high-level primitives into machine-language programs.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Compiler</td>
		<td>Compile several machine instructions into short sequences to simulate the activity requested<br> by a single high-level primitive.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Interpreter</td>
		<td>Executes the instructions as they were translated instead of recording the translated version for future use.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cross-Platform Software</td>
		<td>Software that is independent of an operating system’s design as well as the machine’s<br> hardware design and is therefore executable throughout a network.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Natural Language</td>
		<td>Spoken languages of the world such as English, German, Spanish, and Mandarin.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Formal Language</td>
		<td>Programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and COBOL.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Machine Independence</td>
		<td>Languages that do not refer to the attributes of any particular machine. <br>They can be compiled as easily for one machine as for another.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>High-Level Programming Language</td>
		<td>Provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program. They leverage millions<br> of lines of library code, invoke built-in operating system functions, or initiate complex interactions with networks and databases. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</td>
		<td>Software system is viewed as a collection of units, each of which is capable of performing the actions<br> that are immediately related to itself as well as requesting actions of other objects. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Scripting Language</td>
		<td>A subset of the imperative languages. They are typically used to perform<br> administrative tasks rather than to develop complex programs.</td>
	</tr>

		<td>Data Types:
			<ul>
				<li>Integer</li>
				<li>Float</li>
				<li>String</li>		
			</ul>
		</td>
		<td>
			<ul>&nbsp;
				<li>Numeric data consisting of whole numbers.</li>

				<li>Text data.</li>		
			</ul>
		</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Primitive Data Types</td>
		<td>Data types that are included as primitives in a programming language, such as int for integer and char for character.</td>

		<td>Data Structure</td>
		<td>Conceptual shape or arrangement of data.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Function</td>
		<td>Set of instructions for performing a task that can be used as an abstract tool by other program units.</td>

		<td>Local Variable</td>
		<td>A variable declared within a function. It can be referenced only within that function.</td>
