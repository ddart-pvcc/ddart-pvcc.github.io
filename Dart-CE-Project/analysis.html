        <li>This website provides a small sample of data from the 2023 United States budget. It also describes the funding allocations for two initiatives.<br>
            In addtion, the federal deficit is described with illustrations of comparison to the previous years.<br>
            Finally, on this page, a summary analyis is provided accompanied by an image of the deficit trend since 2001.<br> <br>
        </li>

        <li>The United States budget is complex. Each year, the sitting president submits the full budget to Congress.<br>
            This website describes the funding allocations for the "American Rescue Plan Act of 2021" and Executive Order 14017: "America's Supply Chains."<br> <br>
        </li>
    
        <li>From this research, in this author's opinion, our federal government has made notable improvements to our healthcare system infrastructure and capacity.<br>   
            In addition, despite all the partisan arguments we see in the media, our government has made significant progress in the last year to domesticate manufacturing,<br>
            improve infrastructure, and provide services to the underrepresented.<br><br>
        </li>
    
        <li>It is possible that these inititives will boost opportunity and reduce poverty, improve health and well-being, and advance widely shared prosperity. <br> <br></li>

        <li>Interstingly, these plans seem to have a backbone of fiscal responsibility by paying for them by raising taxes on the wealthy and requiring corporations to pay their fair share.<br><br></li>

        <li> Coming from a fiscally responsible family background, it has always amazed me when the media and government officials <br>
             nonchalantely state the enormous annual deficit and the total government debt.  How is the government allowed to spend over a trillion dollars<br>
             more than it receives in revenue?  The graph below provides a historical perspective to this question.  Maybe one day, our government will <br>
             use business concepts and economics to understand they should budget spending appropriately with revenue.<br><br>
        </li>

        <li>Since 2001, the federal governmentâ€™s budget has run a deficit each year. Starting in 2016, increases in spending<br>
            on Social Security, health care, and interest on federal debt have outpaced the growth of federal revenue. <br>
            From FY 2019 to FY 2021, federal spending increased by about 50 percent in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
