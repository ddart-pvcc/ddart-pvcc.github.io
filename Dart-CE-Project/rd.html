    The federal government ran a deficit of $1.4 trillion in FY2022, approximately half the $2.8 trillion deficit incurred in FY2021. <br>
    Contributing to this change are both increased revenues ($850 billion or 21% higher) and reduced outlays ($548 billion or 8% lower) than in FY2021. <br>
    The expiration of pandemic-related relief spending, such expanded unemployment insurance, certain tax credits, and other public benefit programs, accounts for most of that change.

        <li>$176 billion (8%) for Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, the countryâ€™s largest mandatory spending programs.</li>
        <li>$26 billion (15%) for the Department of Agriculture, primarily for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and <br> nationwide waivers that increased the number of free school meals during the 2021-2022 school year.</li>
        <li>$121 billion (29%) in net interest on the public debt, primarily because higher inflation resulted in large adjustments to the principal of inflation-protected securities.</li>
        <li>$16 billion (81%) for international assistance programs, due to funds authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and emergency support for Ukraine.</li>
